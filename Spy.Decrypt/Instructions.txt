- Create classes that will try to decrypt a string input.
- An initial class will be provided that takes an interface in it's constructor, and it will "receive" encrypted messages, using the interface to decrypt the messages.
- Each class will have a different decryption algorithm
- Eventually will lead to refactoring to the Composite pattern for the interface, along with either Chain of Command or Pipeline


- "Real" input will always begin with a special character and end with a special character when decrypted.
	- This is to verify the decrypted message is correct
